/**
 * Fractional indexing ("lexorank") helper.
 *
 * Produces short string "rank" keys used as a `sortOrder` column so work items
 * can be reordered (drag-and-drop) without renumbering siblings: to move an
 * item, you compute a key that sorts lexicographically strictly between its two
 * new neighbours and write only that one row.
 *
 * Invariants this module guarantees:
 *  - Every key is a non-empty string over the alphabet `a`..`z`.
 *  - No key ever ends in `'a'` (the alphabet's first/min char). This keeps the
 *    "strictly between" arithmetic well-defined: a trailing min char carries no
 *    information (it equals the implicit padding) and would create ambiguity.
 *  - For any two keys produced here with `a < b` (plain string compare),
 *    `calculateMidpoint(a, b)` returns a key `m` with `a < m < b`, ALWAYS —
 *    even when `a` and `b` are lexicographically adjacent. There is no numeric
 *    conversion anywhere, so there is no `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` overflow and
 *    no precision loss; the algorithm is purely per-character.
 *
 * Algorithm (generate a key strictly between `a` and `b`):
 *   Treat a missing lower bound as an infinitely-small string and a missing
 *   upper bound as an infinitely-large string. Walk both strings position by
 *   position. While the character at position `i` is equal in both, copy it to
 *   the result (shared prefix). At the first position where they differ:
 *     - If there is at least one character strictly between `a[i]` and `b[i]`,
 *       emit the midpoint character and stop — done.
 *     - Otherwise `b[i] === a[i] + 1` (adjacent): emit `a[i]`, then "descend"
 *       past the end of `a` — the upper bound is now effectively `+infinity`
 *       for the remaining positions, so we just need a key strictly greater
 *       than the rest of `a`. We append a character strictly above the
 *       remaining tail of `a` (the MID char if the tail is empty, or one above
 *       the tail's first char, recursively descending while that char is the
 *       alphabet max).
 *   This terminates because each descend step consumes one character of `a`,
 *   and once `a` is exhausted appending the MID char is always strictly
 *   greater than "nothing".
